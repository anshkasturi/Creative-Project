    <p>

        Greetings, I'm Paul D, one of the many Paul's that lived on Sweet Home. My story is not unique in that I tried
        to escape
        slavery once,
        failed, and paid the price but on my second attempt things were more in my favor. On the plantation life was
        good until Mr. Garner at which time schoolteacher took over and things took a turn for the worse. After
        escaping, I have tried my very best to erase the trauma I faced at Sweet Home and locked up my heart in a tin
        box. But upon going to 124, an old crush Sethe opened it back up. However, much like Pandora's box a lot more
        than a red heart emerged. I fought off not just one but two full spirits but not until one of them corrupted my
        sweet Sethe. I now spend most of my time caring for her and trying to show her again how valuable she is. I hope
        she can take comfort in knowing I am here for her and that I have many of the same traumatic memories. I hope
        one day, I too can have a family that so many around me have.

    <p>
        Beloved tore my life apart. I was just starting to feel like myself and feel like I belonged to 124 when that
        cruel lady/sprit/abomination Beloved arrived. She manipulated all the women of 124 into speaking a kind of code
        encrypted to beyond my understanding. I tried my hardest to change people's minds about her but nothing worked
        and eventually I was kicked out of 124. Sleeping in the church I started to realize that Beloved was just a
        spirit and an unveiling of the trauma of 124. As if right on time, Denver sought me out and the rest is history.
        Someday soon, I'll get back what she stole from me.
