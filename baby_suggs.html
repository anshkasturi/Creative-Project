    <p>
        Hello kids, my name is Baby Suggs, and I'm a doctor. Not a doctor of the body but one for the soul. I believe
        that along with one's community is where real strength comes from. I've never believed in following society's
        rules since although people are good they can sometimes hurt others as they did myself. After Halle's death,
        I've taken to nurturing
        my community and enriching their souls. I know that my body is tired but my heart still has a lot to give. After
        my daughter-in-law has shown up things have started to get messy since her soul has been tortured. I've taken to
        myself since then and have stopped attending the meetings at the Clearing. I don't like
        some of the decisions Sethe's made but nevertheless it is a teaching moment. I for one believe in her but I hope
        that someday the community can too.

        <dt>“All the time I’m afraid the thing that happened that it made it all right for my mother to kill my sister
            could happen again … whatever it is it comes from outside this house, outside this yard, and it can come on
            in the yard if it wants. So I never leave this house, so it can’t happen again and my mother won’t have to
            kill me, too.”</dt>

    <h1 id="beloved_thoughts">My thoughts on Beloved</h1>
    <p>
        I never saw Beloved during my life but I did anticipate her arrival. Too many bad things happened in 124 for it
        to go unnoticed. I think she might have enough power to corrupt Sethe but I hope Denver, Paul D, and the rest of
        the community can come together to save her. I hope the community doesn't take out their hatred of me on poor
        Sethe.
