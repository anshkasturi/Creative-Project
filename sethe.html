    <h1 id="about">About Me:</h1>
    <p> Hi, I am Sethe, I like to think of myself as a caring mother but off late I seem to have failed at that. I made
        some of the toughest decisions a human should have to make but still I can't seem to catch a break. Growing up
        in isolation, I feel though that my own daughter may not have the societal development that she needs in order
        to escape the trauma that her previous generations have had to endure. I hope that I together with Paul D can
        piece together a semblance of life for her now that Beloved is gone. I still though am proud of everything she
        has done to this day and expect even greater things from her post college.

        <dt>Beloved, she my daughter. She mine. See. She come back to me of her own free will and I don’t have to explain a thing. I didn’t have time to explain before because it had to be done quick. Quick. She had to be safe and I put her where she would be.</dt>

    <p>Beloved represented something in me that I couldn't keep away from myself. I knew she was bad for me the moment
        she arrived but as a mother I felt a duty towards her care. As she evolved, I realized our roles had flipped
        and she started commanding me around. As a mother, you always do whats best for your kid so I obeyed unknowing
        what would become of me. After a point, I didn't know who I was and how much control over my own actions I had.
        Thankfully, my real daughter and husband saved me and for that I am incredibly grateful.
