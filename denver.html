    <p>
        Hi, I'm Denver, Sethe's daughter and formerly Beloved's sister. I'm 18 years old biologically but I feel younger
        compared to other kids my age. In some ways though I do feel cooler too. I can talk to things and people that
        are invisible. Nobody
        believes me but soon they will see. I used to remember teh days when I was scared to leave the house but after
        teh Beloved ordeal thats all gone thanks to the help of Ms. Bodwin and Paul D. I really don't like Paul D, but I
        will say he's a handy man is useful in a pinch. If it weren't for him who knows where I would be right now. My
        current occupation is being a full time student here at Oberlin College and part time caretaker of my mother.

        <dt>“All the time I’m afraid the thing that happened that it made it all right for my mother to kill my sister
            could happen again … whatever it is it comes from outside this house, outside this yard, and it can come on
            in the yard if it wants. So I never leave this house, so it can’t happen again and my mother won’t have to
            kill me, too.”</dt>

    <p>
        I used to really like Beloved. I thought of her as a sister that I never had. When Paul D chased away baby
        ghost,
        and Beloved returned I knew it was destiny telling me my abilities. I felt her and I could be best friends even
        though mom hated her. But as time progressed, I realized Beloved might not be the sister, I thought she was and
        she started to bully and command Mother. This angered me because eve though Mother was not my best friend, I
        knew Halle would want me to keep her safe so that I did. I just wish I had realized sooner who Beloved really
        was so I could've stopped her from entering my family's lives in the first place. But I don't regret it for if
        Beloved would've never appeared I might not be the woman I am today.
